The UnrealScript Language Service is an extension for VSCode powered by our own Language Service Provider adding support for the UnrealScript language.

We'd greatly appreciate any contributions such as the following, but not limited to: new linting rules, bug fixes, custom UnrealScript features support, new code actions, among new possible features that we don't have yet, such as formatting.
